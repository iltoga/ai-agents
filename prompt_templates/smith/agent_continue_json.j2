The following plan contains errors:

{{previous_response}}

I have fixed this one for you:
Action: {{action}}
Action Input: {{action_input}}
Observation: {{observation}}

Rewrite and fix the plan. Just output the json response.
Reproduce the same steps until the step that contained the errors. After that, continue with the new plan.
Try not to increase the number of required steps to reach the goal.
Observations should be summarized as short as possible given their context.
It is very important that you never use single (') of double (") quotes in Thought, ActionInput and Observation.
