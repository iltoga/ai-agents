{{initial_prompt}}

The following plan contains a few errors:

{{previous_response}}

I have fixed this one for you:
Action: {{action}}
Action Input: {{action_input}}
Observation: {{observation}}

Write the fixed plan. Dont's start with "Sure, here's a new plan based on your changes:".
Reproduce the same steps until the one that contained errors, then, continue with the new plan.
Observations must always be summarized given their context (they have to try to answer to their relative Action Input) in the most concise way possible.
